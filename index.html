          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <img src="assets/images/Ashley.jpg" alt="profile picture" id="image">
          <p>I am currently a Sr. Associate Product Manager at a leading office furniture design company. I oversee numerous projects from concept to customer. Although I am a product manager by day, I am an aspiring coder by night attending the University of Minnesota's Coding Bootcamp. My favorite part of coding and web development is the problem-solving and trouble shooting.</p>
          <p>When I am not working or studying the art of coding I am hanging out with my dog, a black lab named Hank. I am also attending rock concerts with my husband, Ross. As a family we are also in the process of renovating our house; I project manage, Ross does the manual labor, and Hank supervises.</p>
